# BusinessCardParsing

**Make sure to have at least Java 8 installed**

1) To run the program, you can open a terminal and browse to:
   out/artifacts/BusinessCardOCR_jar
   
2) Once you're in that directory, run:
   java -jar BusinessCardOCR.jar
   
3) The program should now be running in your terminal.

4) Enter the absolute path to a .txt business card. For example, /Users/Dave/Desktop/businessCard1.txt
**I have included a folder ('sample inputs') for 3 sample business card inputs.**

5) Enjoy parsing business cards!
